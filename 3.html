  <p>This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2019 Language.
    It is the tenth edition of the ECMAScript Language
    Specification. Since publication of the first edition
    in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's
    most widely used general-purpose programming languages.
    It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers
    but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded
    applications.
